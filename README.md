### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: <b> Do Communist philosophers and Capitalist philosophers have different goals for society? </b>
+ This project is conducted by Nixon Mckenzie

+ Project summary: The goal of this analysis is to identify the goals from the perspective of the Capitalist school of thought and Communist school of thought. They've been portrayed as opposites throughout history but how different are they? Who is their intended audience and what are they asking of their audience? What does each school of thought want you to focus on? I attempt to explore these topics using a large philosophy dataset.
